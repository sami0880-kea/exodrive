## Full Stack Elective - Prof. Bachelor Software KEA 2025

ExoDrive is an online car marketplace like Bilbasen.dk and mobile.de, specifically tailored
for sports and exotic cars. It offers vehicles both with VAT included and without the full
Danish registration fee paid. Due to Denmark's high car taxes, expensive vehicles are
commonly leased for shorter periods, typically 12-24 months. After such a lease period,
the person who leased the car typically becomes responsible for the vehicle's residual
value. As Denmarkâ€™s car market is very limited for sport and exotic cars, it is often hard to
sell cars, especially those without full registration fees paid. ExoDrive fixes this issue by
providing a platform to list cars available after the lease period ends, as well as listing an of
ongoing leasing agreements for someone else to continue it.

The platform has been developed using the MERN stack, React, styled with Tailwind CSS,
and Radix UI. The backend is made in Node.js and Express and MongoDB as the database.
I also use Cloudinary as for cloud storage for managing car listing images.
